# Javascript Roman Numeral Encoder and Decoder

This is a personal implementation of a Roman Numeral Converter. It's a class with **static methods**, which means that you can access the methods without creating an instance of the class.

### The *RomanNumerals* class has the following methods:

#### 1. static toRoman(number) - Takes a *number* and returns a *string* of that value converted to Roman Numerals. Returns an error if the argument is less than 1 or if it's type isn't "number".

#### 2. static fromRoman(string) - Takes a *string*(a Roman numeral) and converts it to a *number* of the same value. Returns an error if the argument contains an invalid letter or if it's type isn't "string".
